# Memory Flip
Memory Flip is a card matching game meant to test your memory & recall skills!  
You will be presented with a grid of cards (default 4x4), which you can flip over.  
Once you flip over two cards, they will be highlighted in <span style="color: green">green</span> or <span style="color: red">red</span> based on whether they match.  
There are also counters on the bottom of the page tracking your **tries** and **% correct**.  
You can switch between **2x2**, **4x4**, **6x6**, **8x8**, and **10x10** at the top of the page.  
You can also switch between dark and light modes. Scroll down to see how each theme looks.
